Today I read a book written by Scott Young. Some point of views of this book remind me of many important knowledge about learning which I learned during my high school days.

The first half part can be skipped I think. Kind of some meaningless hype.  

### Summary here:  

 **TO DESIGN A GOOD PROJECT:**  

A good project starts off with a welldesigned plan.   
Many learners rush into learning endeavors that are illconceived, and when they inevitably encounter difficulties they get frustrated and give up. (Yes, that the way most of the time I did my project.)

1. **Pick your constraints carefully.**  
In each of my challenges, I carefully chose constraints that would limit what I was trying to learn or how I was going to learn it. These constraints make the project easier to work on because they eliminate all the possible distractions you could encounter.   
2. **Set aside enough time.**  
Set aside clear chunks of time to work on your project and make them a priority. Ultralearning is worth the effort. But it doesn’t work if you don’t make it work.   
3. **Limit your materials and methods.**  
It’s easy to go overboard and try to learn everything. Pick a few key resources and a few key methods to start. Only once those fail should you think about branching out.  

 **TO BECOME MORE PRODUCTIVE AND FOCUSED:**    

1. **Eliminate distractions.**   
Work without internet, cellphones, TV or distractions. If you need breaks, do something relaxing but not distracting like getting a glass of water, meditating or going for a walk. Don’t turn on the TV because you’re bored.   
2. **Create a productivity system.**  
Schedule your time and work carefully. If you plan it out in advance, you’ll rarely be in a situation where it’s impossible to work on your project because of other priorities. If you don’t schedule your day, then you’ll always be playing catchup.   
3. **Progressively train your focus.**  
Don’t start out trying to lift the world in a day. Start small and progressively build up. If you can only focus for 15 minutes at a time, aim for 20 minutes. As you get better, you’ll be able to sustain concentration for longer without giving up.   

 **USE FEEDBACK CYCLES TO ACCELERATE THE LEARNING PROCESS:**   

1. **Do the cycles more quickly.**  
Instead of waiting until the entire assignment is done to compare your work to the solution, why not do it after each question? Faster feedback is faster learning.   
2. **Do the cycles more deeply.**  
The more elaborately you can practice, the more you’ll test comprehensive skills. Doing a full project, therefore, can teach you things that doing flashcards won’t.  
3. **Get more accurate feedback.**   
If you can improve the accuracy of your feedback, you’ll need fewer cycles to make corrections.  


### Other tips while learning :

1. **SPACE YOUR PRACTICE OUT**  
What’s better for learning outcomes? Study for five hours straight or five, onehour chunks over two weeks?   
The learning research is clear: spacing out your practice results in much stronger, longer memories than bunching it in one spot. One way to apply this is to do frequent review testing on material you’ve already learned. By adding more practice over time, after you’ve first learned something, you can make those memories and knowledge last much longer.   

2. **PROCESS DEEPLY TO RETAIN MORE**  
Imagine you’re running an experiment to see what methods cause people to remember words better from a list. One group you split them by motivation: you tell half of them there will be an important test later, so they’d better study, while the others you ask them to read a list, but don’t tell them why. The second group you split by processing instructions. You tell one half to mentally note which words contain the letter “e”. You tell the other half to note which words are pleasant or not. Which condition, motivation or processing, do you expect matters more for memory?   
Surprisingly the answer is overwhelming: it’s processing that matters. Motivation doesn’t actually do much at all for memory, but processing words more deeply (such as thinking about their pleasantness) caused participants to remember almost twice as much.  
The conclusion: there’s more than one way to absorb information. If you can do it by processing deeply (say by paraphrasing your notes, rather than writing them down verbatim; summarizing rather than highlighting while reading) you’ll retain more.    

3. **OVERLEARNING**  
When you first start practicing a skill, you’ll get better and better at it – for awhile. Then, you’ll stop seeing much improvement. At this point, you’ve mastered the skill. Does that mean it’s time to stop practicing and move onto something else? Actually, when you continue to practice beyond what you need to perform a skill, this causes you to improve your ability to retain the skill.   
So the first phase of learning improves your ability, the second phase, what scientists call overlearning, causes you to remember the skill longer.   
There are two ways you can use this. The first is to overlearn the most useful components of the skill you’re practicing. If you’re learning a language, you want to overlearn the most frequent parts of speech. If you’re learning math, you want to overlearn common algebraic patterns. The second is that if you want to maintain a skill for life, it’s important to practice it beyond where you feel you’re not seeing improvement anymore.
