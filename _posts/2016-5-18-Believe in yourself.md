Thanks for all the kindness from my dearly beloveds.

I was too confident of myself that even can be called conceited.

But if I didn't try, I shall never know that I can't, neither to know when and how to succeed.
Aren't that all the pains and torments what make people stronger? If there were no loneliness and helplessness, how can we explicitly feel the cares from our beloved ones?

I'll go on believing in myself. I will be so distressed for not being eligible to heal the hurt that you may have been suffering, as well as feeling so regretful for losing the opportunity of obtaining a long-term happiness. But I will bear all the consequences, taste the sweets and bitters, ups and downs of new life, establish new connections with new people surround me, learn how to survive by myself as an individual. Follow my inner heart, learn all what I need to obtain what I really want, and be more like myself.

I shall say nothing, but may my love always surrounds by your side.
